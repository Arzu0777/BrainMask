ðŸ§  BrainMask
Brain Tumor Segmentation using Attention U-Net with Squeeze-and-Excitation Blocks


ðŸ“Œ Overview
BrainMask is a deep learning project for automatic brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans, developed using the BraTS 2021 dataset.
It combines Attention U-Net, Residual Connections, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Blocks to achieve high segmentation accuracy.

ðŸš€ Features
Multi-class tumor segmentation (Whole Tumor, Tumor Core, Enhancing Tumor)

Attention Mechanism for improved focus on tumor regions

Residual + SE Blocks for better feature representation

Grad-CAM Visualizations for model interpretability

High Performance â€“ optimized for Dice and IoU scores above 0.85
