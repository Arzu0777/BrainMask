## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
**BrainMask** is a deep learning project for **automatic Whole Tumor segmentation** from brain MRI scans, developed on the **BraTS 2021** dataset.  
The model architecture is based on **Attention U-Net** with **Residual Connections** and **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Blocks**, designed for high accuracy in medical image segmentation.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Whole Tumor segmentation** from brain MRI (single class)  
- **Attention Mechanism** for improved tumor localization  
- **Residual + SE Blocks** for enhanced feature extraction  
- **High Performance** â€“ optimized for Dice and IoU metrics  
- Supports **training, evaluation, and prediction** pipelines
