ðŸ§  BrainMask
Whole Tumor Segmentation in Brain MRI using Attention U-Net with Squeeze-and-Excitation Blocks


ðŸ“Œ Overview
BrainMask is a deep learning project for automatic Whole Tumor segmentation from brain MRI scans, developed on the BraTS 2021 dataset.
The model architecture is based on Attention U-Net with Residual Connections and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Blocks, designed for high accuracy in medical image segmentation.

ðŸš€ Features
Whole Tumor segmentation from brain MRI (single class)

Attention Mechanism for improved tumor localization

Residual + SE Blocks for enhanced feature extraction

High Performance â€“ optimized for Dice and IoU metrics

Supports training, evaluation, and prediction pipelines
